    <h2>Welcome to my About Section :D</h2>

    <p>Hi there, I'm Emirhan Yildirim and I am a domestic student who came here overseas just to get to know the difference in the education system of my country, which is considered as a developing country, compared to this developed country. I wanted to learn things in a new way. I'm pursuing Computer Programming at Seneca College because it is one of the best colleges Canada has right now, and I wanted to learn about coding. I love to play soccer and volleyball. I love to go out with my friends and have as much fun as I can.</p>
    
    <p>New things I wanna learn this year can be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning a new programming language, such as Python, Java, or JavaScript, which can broaden your skillset and improve your versatility in different coding environments.</li>
        <li>Exploring web development, which includes learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.</li>
        <li>Diving into mobile app development, where you can create applications for Android or iOS using languages like Kotlin or Swift.</li>
        <li>Studying data science, which involves using programming languages like Python or R to analyze and interpret complex data sets.</li>
        <li>Learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can enable you to create smart algorithms and systems that can learn and adapt.</li>
        <li>Experimenting with game development, using engines like Unity or Unreal Engine to create immersive and interactive games.</li>
        <li>Exploring cybersecurity, which involves understanding how to protect systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.</li>
        <li>Understanding DevOps practices, which help in managing and automating the software development process to improve efficiency and collaboration.</li>
        <li>Getting familiar with cloud computing platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which are essential for modern web and application development.</li>
        <li>Engaging in open-source projects, where you can contribute to existing software projects and collaborate with other developers worldwide.</li>
    </ul>
